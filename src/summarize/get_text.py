"""
The content of this module was adapted and mostly taken verbatim from the gutenbergypy project:
https://github.com/raduangelescu/gutenbergpy/blob/master/gutenbergpy/textget.py
which was itself taken from the gutenberg project:
https://github.com/c-w/Gutenberg
in which the strip_headers function was ported from a C++ version by Johannes Krugel which no longer appears to be available.
I have added a line to TEXT_END_MARKERS and changed the return value of strip_headers to encode the output text
